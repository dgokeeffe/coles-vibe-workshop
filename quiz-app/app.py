        options=["$90", "$170", "$230", "$310"],
        correct=2,
        explanation="$15B/month ÷ 26M people ÷ 4.3 weeks ≈ $134 per person — but that's individuals. Per household (~10M) it's ~$350/week. Per capita including eating out: ~$230.",
    ),
    Question(
        category="DATA PUZZLE",
        question="NSW has the highest food retail turnover. But which state has the highest turnover per capita?",
        options=["ACT", "NSW", "Western Australia", "Northern Territory"],
        correct=0,
        explanation="ACT punches above its weight — high average incomes + no nearby regional alternatives = highest per-capita food spend. NSW wins on raw volume but not per-person.",
    ),
    Question(
        category="GOTCHA",
        question="You run a pipeline that ingests ABS retail data monthly. March 2024 shows a 40% spike in NSW food turnover. What's the most likely cause?",
        options=[
            "A genuine demand surge",
            "Easter fell in March that year",
            "ABS revised historical data",
            "Seasonal adjustment wasn't applied",
        ],
        correct=3,
        explanation="ABS publishes both seasonally adjusted AND original series. A 40% spike in original data is normal — Easter timing shifts, school holidays, etc. Always check which series you're ingesting.",
    ),
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # ROUND 2: AI & SYCOPHANCY (tricky / counterintuitive)
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question(
        category="AI TRAPS",
        question="Stanford tested 11 LLMs (2026): when the user was 100% wrong, how often did the AI still agree?",
        options=["12% of the time", "28% of the time", "51% of the time", "73% of the time"],
        correct=2,
        explanation="51% — worse than a coin flip. RLHF optimises for user satisfaction, not truth. This is why structural verification (BDD, schema contracts) matters more than asking 'did this work?'",
    ),
    Question(
        category="AGENT PITFALLS",
        question="You ask an AI agent to 'build a data pipeline.' It produces 12 files, a custom logging framework, and an abstract base class hierarchy. What went wrong?",
        options=[
            "The model is too powerful",
            "You didn't constrain scope in CLAUDE.md",

        ],
        correct=1,
        explanation="Overeagerness is the #1 agent pitfall. Without constraints like 'minimal solution, no abstractions unless asked,' agents default to over-engineering. One line in CLAUDE.md prevents this.",

        category="CRITICAL THINKING",
        question="Your agent says 'I've verified the pipeline works correctly.' What should you do?",

            "Both B and C",
        ],
        correct=3,
        explanation="Never trust claims — demand proof (git diff, test results). Then apply the Karpathy Test: ask the model to argue the opposite. If it can demolish its own work, the work wasn't solid.",

    # ROUND 3: DATA ENGINEERING (technical / applied)
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question(
        category="DATA ENGINEERING",

        options=[
            "Creates partitioned folders on disk",
            "Sorts data within files for faster predicate pushdown",
            "Creates an index like a traditional database",
            "Nothing — CLUSTER BY is ignored on serverless",
        ],
        correct=1,
        explanation="CLUSTER BY uses liquid clustering — it colocates data within files (Z-ordering) so queries with predicates on those columns skip irrelevant file groups. It's NOT partitioning.",
    ),
    Question(
        category="PIPELINE GOTCHA",
        question="Your streaming table reads from Auto Loader. You deploy, it works. Next day: 0 new rows. The source files are there. What's the most likely cause?",
        options=[
            "The checkpoint was corrupted",
            "The source path changed and Auto Loader's checkpoint tracks the OLD path",
            "Serverless compute timed out",
            "Unity Catalog permissions were revoked",
        ],
        correct=1,
        explanation="Auto Loader checkpoints are path-specific. If someone moved the source files or changed the path in config, the checkpoint still watches the old location. Classic 'silent zero rows' bug.",
    ),
    Question(
        category="DATA QUALITY",
        question="You add @dp.expect_or_fail('valid_amount', 'amount > 0') to your Silver table. 3 rows fail. What happens?",
        options=[
            "The 3 rows are dropped, rest succeeds",
            "The entire pipeline update fails",
            "The 3 rows are quarantined to an error table",
            "A warning is logged but all rows pass through",
        ],
        correct=1,
        explanation="expect_or_fail is strict — ANY row failing the constraint causes the entire update to fail. Use @dp.expect (warn only) or @dp.expect_or_drop (filter) for softer handling.",
    ),
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # ROUND 4: YOUR OWN PLATFORM (Coles-specific)
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question(

        correct=2,
        explanation="30,000+ active tables under UC governance as of March 2026. UC replaced Amundsen + Apache Atlas + JanusGraph as Coles' data governance layer.",

    Question(
        category="YOUR PLATFORM",
        question="What percentage of Coles' Databricks compute (DBUs) currently runs on Unity Catalog?",

        correct=2,
        explanation="71% of DBU consumption is on UC, against a target of 80%. The gap is mostly ETL workloads still on Classic compute — migrating those to UC-native pipelines is an active initiative.",
    ),
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # ROUND 5: ESTIMATION & DEBATE (fun / no clear right answer)
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question(

        correct=1,
        explanation="A standard Coles carries ~20,000-25,000 SKUs. A Coles Local might have ~8,000. Costco carries ~4,000. For context, a single ABS category like 'bread & cereals' covers thousands of these.",

    Question(
        category="DEBATE",
        question="An AI agent writes code 10x faster than a human. Measured studies show AI-authored code has 1.7x more major issues. Net effect on team velocity?",
        options=[
            "Massive improvement — speed outweighs bugs",
            "Roughly break-even after accounting for review and fixes",
            "Net negative — bugs compound faster than speed gains",
            "Depends entirely on the review process",
        ],
        correct=3,
        explanation="This is the real answer. Speed without verification is just faster bugs. With BDD gates, CLAUDE.md constraints, and code review — the 10x speed compounds positively. Without them, it compounds negatively.",
    ),
    Question(
        category="WILDCARD",
        question="In 2024, Australia recalled 847 food products (FSANZ data). Which category had the most recalls?",
